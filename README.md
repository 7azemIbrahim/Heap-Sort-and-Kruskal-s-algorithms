# Heap-Sort and Kruskals algorithms
## Overview

This repository contains implementations for two fundamental algorithms:

Heap-Sort Algorithm: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

Kruskal's Algorithm: A greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.

Both implementations are written in Python and include detailed analyses of their time and space complexities.
